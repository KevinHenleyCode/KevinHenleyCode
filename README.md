### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Biography

- I started programming in college but didnâ€™t realize until after I had graduated that that would be what I wanted to do. So, I decided to attend the Rice University Full Stack Bootcamp. It was there that I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Express, MySQL, MongoDB and React.



## Currently

- I graduated from the Rice Bootcamp in August of 2021
- Iâ€™m currently working on many different projects to not only increase my skills in the MERN stack but also learning Angular and AWS tech.
- I'm am still looking for a job so I have included a links in my contacts portion of this README.
