## About me

- I started programming in college but didn’t realize until after I had graduated that that would be what I wanted to do. So, I decided to attend the Rice University Full Stack Bootcamp. It was there that I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Express, MySQL, MongoDB and React.
