## Biography

- I started programming in college but didnâ€™t realize until after I had graduated that that would be what I wanted to do. So, I decided to attend the Rice full stack bootcamp. It has been there that I have learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am now currently working with Node.js and the rest of the MERN backend.
