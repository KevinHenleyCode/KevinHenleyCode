## About me

- I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with a strong foundation in modern frontend and backend technologies. Originally introduced to programming in college, I found my true passion after graduating and enrolled in the Rice University Full Stack Bootcamp. Since then, I've built a career crafting efficient, user-focused web applications and continually expanding my skill set.
